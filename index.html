    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>PyGarmin is a set of <a
    href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> classes which
    implement the protocol used by <a
    href="http://www.garmin.com">Garmin</a> GPS receivers to talk
    to each other and to other machines. It is based on the
    official <a
    href="http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html">protocol
    specification</a>. The project was started by <a
    href="http://www.qandr.org">Quentin
    Stafford-Fraser</a> but several others have helped to make it
    what it is today.</p>

    <p>PyGarmin is not a complete application.  Some simple
    applications are now included, one of which is called pygarmin,
    but it is primarily just a toolkit to help you write
    applications. (I'm assuming you know how to program in <a
    href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. If you don't, check it
    out. It won't take you long to learn, and is well worth it.) This
    is a project which is in development. No support.  No
    guarantees. And so forth.</p>

    <p>Having said all of that, this has been used to transfer
    information to and from several different Garmin receivers,
    mostly under Linux, though there is some Windows support now
    as well. If you use PyGarmin, it will probably be much
    quicker than writing your own software from scratch. If it
    works on your GPS, let us know. If it doesn't, let us know.
    The more info you can give us about what went wrong, the more
    likely we are to fix it.</p>

    <p>If you want to cut straight to the code go to the
    SourceForge project page mentioned above. But I suggest you
    read on first. The code looks quites scary if you don't know
    what's happening!</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>Almost every model of Garmin receiver implements a
    slightly different protocol. They have many things in common,
    but there are minor differences. For example, some receivers
    can display icons, and they therefore transmit waypoints
    which have an extra 'symbol' field, which is not used in other models.
    Others don't use icons, but do store altitude. And so forth.
    You need to get the protocol right for your particular
    model.</p>

    <p>This makes matters more complicated, but at least these
    things are well documented by Garmin. The
    <a href="http://www.garmin.com/support/commProtocol.html">specification</a>
    includes a big table which details, for each product type,
    what protocol it uses for basic commands, what it uses for
    downloading waypoints, what it uses for downloading routes,
    and so forth.</p>

    <p>I have created Python classes for each of the protocols
    listed in the spec, and for each of the data types. Well,
    most of them. The big table becomes, in Python, a mapping
    from the Garmin product ID to the set of relevant classes.
    This means that, while there are a large number of classes
    defined in the source, only a few of them will ever be used
    by any given receiver. The classes are all given names based
    on those used in the specification, so look at the spec if you
    want to know more about the classes.</p>

    <p>The class <tt>garmin.Garmin</tt> will connect to
    your GPS, read its product ID and software version, and then
    look up the appropriate classes in the table. It creates
    instances of the protocol classes and notes the datatype
    classes for each type of data used in the transmisisons. It
    also has some friendly methods like 'getWaypoints', which do
    what you would expect. What you get back when you call
    this is a list of objects, each of which is an instance of a
    class derived from garmin.Waypoint, but the precise type of
    the objects will depend on the GPS you're talking to.</p>

    <p>OK. Here's a simple Python program.  You may need to set
    suitable permissions on the serial port (e.g /dev/ttyS0) before
    running it.</p>

    <div class="code">
      <table width="90%" border="0" bgcolor="#ffeeff"
      cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td><span class="comment">#! /usr/local/bin/python</span>
          <br />
          <span class="comment"># Load the module</span>
          <br />
          <tt>import garmin</tt>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="comment"># Create a 'physical layer' connection
          using serial port</span>
          <br />
          <tt>phys = garmin.UnixSerialLink("/dev/ttyS0")</tt>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="comment"># Create a Garmin object using this
          connection</span>
          <br />
          <tt>gps = garmin.Garmin(phys)</tt>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="comment"># Get the waypoints from the GPS</span>
          <br />
          <span class="comment"># (This may take a little while)</span>
          <br />
          <tt>waypoints = gps.getWaypoints()</tt>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="comment"># Print the waypoints</span>
          <br />
          <tt>for w in waypoints:</tt>
          <br />
          <tt>    print w.ident,
          <br />
               lat = garmin.degrees(w.slat)
          <br />
              lon = garmin.degrees(w.slon)
          <br />
               print lat, lon, w.cmnt</tt>
          <br />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>Simple, eh? This should work for almost any model, because
    all waypoints will have an identity, a latitude &amp;
    longitude, and a comment field. The latitude and longitude
    are stored in 'semicircle' coordinates (basically degrees,
    but scaled to fill a signed long integer), and so the fields
    are called 'slat' and 'slon'. The function
    <tt>garmin.degrees()</tt> converts these to degrees.</p>

    <h2>More details</h2>

    <p>There are 3 levels of protocol documented:</p>

    <div class="c2">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="2">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#ffffe0" align="center"><b>Application
          layer</b></td>

          <td>(highest level)</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#e0ffff" align="center"><b>Link
          layer</b></td>

          <td> </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#e0ffe0" align="center"><b>Physical
          layer</b></td>

          <td>(lowest level)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>The specification documents the various different versions
    of these under labels of Pxxx, Lxxx, Axxx etc, where xxx is a
    number, and this convention is followed here. There are also
    various data types, named Dxxx. Roughly speaking, the
    Physical protocols specify RS232, the Link protocols specify
    a packet structure for sending messages to and fro, and the
    Application protocols specify what can actually go in those
    packets.</p>

    <p>For example, a Garmin GPS 38 will talk to your computer
    over physical layer P000 (RS232) using a packet structure
    defined by link layer L001. If you want to transfer waypoints
    to and from it, they will be sent using application layer
    A100 (a waypoint transfer protocol), and the actual waypoints
    transferred will be of type D100.</p>

    <p>At the time of writing, the only documented physical layer
    is P000 which is roughly RS232 at 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no
    parity, 1 stop bit. In the software, we model this as a P000
    class that has read and write methods, which can be used by
    the higher protocol levels. The UnixSerialPort class used in
    the sample code above is a subtype of P000.</p>

    <p>I hope that's enough to get you going.</p>

    <p>Some data type classes are not implemented here, just because I
    got bored of typing. We've done the ones used by the more common
    units, but if yours isn't covered, it should be easy to
    add. They're only a few lines each.</p>
